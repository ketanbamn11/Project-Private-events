|---------|------------|-----------|---------------|----------|-------------|-----|
|         |            |           |               |          |             |     |

## Relationships

- **One-to-Many Relationship (User to Parties):**
  - One user can host multiple parties.
  - Each party is hosted by exactly one user.
  - This is represented by the `HostUserID` foreign key in the `Parties` table.

- **Many-to-Many Relationship (User to Invitations):**
  - A user can be invited to multiple parties.
  - Each party can invite multiple users.
  - This is represented by the `Invitations` table, which links `User` and `Party` entities.

## Functionality

- **Creating a Party:**
  - When a user creates a party, a new record is inserted into the `Parties` table with the relevant details (e.g., name, date/time, location).

- **Inviting Guests:**
  - To invite guests, the host creates records in the `Invitations` table, linking the `PartyID` and the `UserID` of each invited guest. The initial status could be "Pending".

- **Accepting/Declining Invitations:**
  - When a user accepts or declines an invitation, the `Status` field in the `Invitations` table is updated accordingly.

## Additional Considerations

- **Security:**
  - Ensure passwords are securely hashed and stored.
  - Implement proper authentication and authorization mechanisms.

- **Performance:**
  - Depending on the expected scale, consider indexing key columns like `UserID`, `PartyID`, and `InvitationID` for faster query performance.

- **Scalability:**
  - Design the database to handle potential growth in users, parties, and invitations.

- **User Interface Integration:**
  - The data architecture should support integration with the user interface for seamless interaction (e.g., displaying parties a user has created, invitations they've received, etc.).
